<h1>Welcome to Flashpath!</h1>
        <h2>Wait, what?</h2>
        <p>This is flashpath, a simple and miniscule hosting system(796B compressed and gzipped as of v0.1 product release)</p>
        <h3>How do I start the Server?</h3>
        <h4>All</h4>
        <p>To start your server, make sure you have nodejs installed and type <span class="code-inline">node (path to flashpath/Server.js)</span></p>
        <h2>What's new with 0.1-2?</h2>
        <p>Flashpath 0.1-2 has now add 404 pages! For the time being (until I can add config files) these are not customizable.</p>
        <h2>What the difference between dev and product releases?</h2>
        <p>When I make an substantial edit to the source I will make an addional build to the dev release. 
            Product releases are released every 100 builds and are compiled and gzipped.
            With every build I will also produce a new install file.
        </p>
