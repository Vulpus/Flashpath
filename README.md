# Welcome to Flashpath!

## Wait, what?

This is flashpath, a simple and miniscule hosting system(796B compressed and
gzipped as of v0.1 product release)

### How do I start the Server?

#### All OS

To start your server, make sure you have nodejs installed and type ```node``` (path
to flashpath/Server.js)
#### What if I don't have nodejs installed

You can install node.js at http://www.nodejs.org or the node_modules/install_dependancies(bash) file will install ALL depenancies for you (Takes along time)
## What's new with 0.1-2?

Flashpath 0.1-2 has now add 404 pages! For the time being, in your config.json file there is a error object. That is where you edit the 404 page.

## What the difference between dev and product releases?

When I make an substantial edit to the source I will make an addional build to
the dev release. Product releases are released every 100 builds and are
compiled and gzipped. With every release I will also produce a new install file.
